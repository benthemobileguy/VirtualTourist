# Virtual Tourist

**Summary:**

This application was created purposely for the [Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com). The app will allow users to drop pins on a map, as if they were stops on a tour. Users will then be able to download pictures for the location and persist both the pictures, and the association of the pictures with the pin.

**The application offers the following features:**

* Finding Flickr Photos In Different Locations

**Technologies Used In Application:**

* UINavigationController
* UICollectionViews
* MVC
* Swift 5
* API's
* Extensions


**Testing The App:**

* Download the project to your computer from this project page.
* Once the project is downloaded, open the .xcodeproj file from the folder.
* Run the project either using the iPhone simulator or your device. I recommend running the project on the latest iPhone device. It should be compiled with the latest version of Xcode.
* If you choose to download it on your device, please plug in your device to your computer and make the device target your device model. Then click 'run'.

**Closing:**

I worked with UIKit, MapKit, API's and am able to successfully create applications using navigation, a long with additional libraries.
